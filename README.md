# Real-Time-Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-System

Overview

This project involves building a real-time stock market data analysis and prediction system. The system leverages open-source tools, cloud computing, and machine learning techniques to process and analyze large-scale stock market data in real-time. The project includes data ingestion, processing, storage, machine learning for prediction, and visualization.

System Architecture

Components:

Data Ingestion: Real-time acquisition of stock market data from multiple APIs.

Data Processing: Using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.

Machine Learning: Implementing models for stock price prediction.

Data Storage: Using a time-series database like InfluxDB.

Web Application: Frontend for data visualization and user interaction.

Deployment: Using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
